"""

To do:

Mutation and crossover rates for genalg
Genetic algorithm optimisation
A way to plot the results from genetic algorithm e.g. spider plot or PC plot
Fix empty/double plot issue
Stochastic model
Paramsliderplot with arbitrary number of sliders
Change parplot function
Paramsliderplots don't like the ends of the sliders
Better way to deal with axis labels?
Better definition of asymmetry index
Maybe autoname jobs (with more characters) to avoid overwriting data. Can be manually overwritten
Animations not starting from zero
More comments to clarify things
Should autosave a file in job directory indicating the type of simulation and the arguments
More shared code between plot functions
Change jobid, subjodid, simid arguments to single directory argument?
Function to make animation from any slider plot???
